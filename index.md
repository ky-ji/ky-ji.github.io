## About Me

I am a final-year undergraduate student from the School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian Univeristy, supervised by [Dr.Fei Cheng](https://dblp.org/pid/06/5591.html). Currently, I am focused on building efficient Embodied AI systems. My research interests include but are not limited to efficient diffusion models for robotic control.

## Education 
Sep. 2021 - Present, B.E in Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University  
From Sep. 2025, Incoming Ph.D. in Computer Science and Technology, MMLab@SIGS, Tsinghua University

## Research Interests

- **Efficient AI:** memory-efficient, computation-efficient, and data-efficient algorithms for training, fine-tuning, and inference
- **Emodied AI:** vision-language-action models, diffusion polices.

## News

- **[Sep. 2024]** Our paper about efficient continual learning on edge has been accepted to ASP-DAC 2025.
